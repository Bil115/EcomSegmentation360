# EcomSegmentation360

## Project Overview

EcomSegmentation360 is a customer segmentation project that applies RFM analysis, cohort analysis, and K-Means clustering to an e-commerce dataset. The goal is to extract insights into customer purchasing behavior and create data-driven segments for better marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset, which contains multiple CSV files detailing orders, payments, customers, and products.

Key Files:

olist_orders_dataset.csv: Contains order details, including timestamps.

olist_order_payments_dataset.csv: Payment methods and transaction amounts.

olist_customers_dataset.csv: Customer location and ID information.

olist_order_items_dataset.csv: Product details per order.

## Objectives

Perform RFM Analysis: Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores to categorize customers.

Conduct Cohort Analysis: Identify customer retention trends over time.

Apply K-Means Clustering: Segment customers based on their purchasing patterns.

Visualize Insights: Use charts and reports to make findings more interpretable.

## Next Steps

Documentation and Reporting

## Usage

The project will be implemented in Python, using Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization. Detailed steps and findings will be documented as the project progresses.

Note: This README will be updated continuously as the project advances.
